    <h2>Games and stuff for gamers</h2>
    <p>The fun of gaming knows no age limit. A new survey by AARP shows older adults are increasingly playing video games on phones and tablets—most often drawn to classic puzzle, logic, card, and tile games.</p>
    <p>AARP’s latest survey on the topic revealed that 44 percent of Americans age 50+ enjoy video games (interactive digital entertainment) at least once a month, up from 38 percent in 2016. That translates into nearly 51 million gamers in 2019 playing an average of five hours a week, compared to 40 million active players three years ago.</p>
    <p>Notably, leading drivers of the trend are women; 49 percent of women say they regularly play, compared to just 40 percent of men. And nearly 53 percent of women say they’re daily video gamers compared to 39 percent of men.</p>
    <p>Mirroring general shifts in device usage, older Americans are gaming on the go—moving away from computers and laptops (47%) and opting instead to play on their smartphones and tablets (73%).</p>
